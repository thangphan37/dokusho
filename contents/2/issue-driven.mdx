When we do something, we usually do hurry, don't spend enough time thinking. It actually makes the result very bad.
So how to approach a problem effectively? Let's figure it out with me through the book **Issue Driven** by the author Kazuto Ataka.

### What's issue?

The issue is a matter that hasn't been resolving specifically and didn't have a conclusion yet.

Some example about **issue**:
- Company A sells wine, they are looking for a method in order to increase the amount of wine that is sold each year.
- His parents fight, the atmosphere in Nam's family became climaxes. Nam wants his parents to be concord then his family will be happy again.
In this case, **His parents to be concord** is the issue that Nam has to resolve.

Ok, We understood a little bit about *issue* concept but do you know in our life we have tons kinds of **issue**?
We have good *issue*, also have bad *issue*.

So how to know a **issue** is good or bad?

Wow, A good **issue** have to pass 3 conditions:

- We can divide it into many ways, many small issues(**sub-issue**).
- We can create a lot of assumptions.
- That issue has to have an answer.

Come back to the example above. The example one can be seen as a good **issue**. 
Let's try to analyze it a little bit.

**issue**: increase the number of wines sold

**issue** increase the number of wines can be divided to three **sub-issue**:
	- Open the customer from other objects.  
	- Build the advertising plan.  
	- Develop a new wine.

Based on **sub-issue** we can create a lot of assumptions like:
	- Now the customer is younger people so let's find some ways in order to create the customer is the older people.
	- If We decrease 5 percent for the customer who buy wine in last month, can we increase the number of customer?
	- We already have a lot of high alcohol. If we mix wine with some special fruits, what will be happened?
	- So on ...

Now, we have **sub-issue** and **assumptions**. Definitely, The issue will have an answer.

Some tips to approach **issue**:

- Draw, write all of the things about the issue..
- Don't use too much information. Should only use the necessary information.
- Figure issue out from the result desired.
- Create a lot of questions using **So what?**(what will be happened?)
- Take some incredible examples.

We can learn through the **Analyze issue** section.

### The street that **dog** run

What's the meaning of being productive?

Productivity is **quality** and is a result completed in a period of time.

The word **quality** is emphasized because If in a period of time, we can do a lot of work but don't have quality or is bad quality,
It isn't called productivity.

If In a period of time, we do a lot of work without quality, the author asserts we are going on **the street that dog run**

Kazuto Ataka emphasizes if we walk on **the street that dog run**, we will waste a lot of time, and gradually, we become 
less productive person. Why's it? Because on **the street that dog run**, it doesn't have many issues or all of them are **bad issue**.
Assuming We go on **the street that dog run** and success, but in the future, we can't be a leader who can lead the next generation.

An example about **the street that dog run**:
B's job is checking documents, every day, he has to check 500 pages of documents, and sometimes he has to re-check documents a lot of time.
He has to take overtime very late. But in fact, only 10 pages in 500 pages documents are used for the main way.
In here, The author asserts B is going on **the street that dog run**

So we always have to consider a thing before do it. Let's try to find the problem has **good issue** and gradually develop ourselves.
Don't run on **the street that dog run**. Don't care a day how much time do you spend? If you do quality work, it's so great whether it's only 5 minutes.

### Analyze issue

When we filtered **issue**, we're going to analyze it.
There are 3 steps to analyze a **issue**:

#### Divide into **sub-issue**

The reason we need to divide into **sub-issue** is we can easy to see the picture of matter and can create the priority matter
 to resolve.

#### Based on **issue** create assumptions
##### Create questions: Where, What, How, Why
	- Where do we have to consider?  
	- What do we have to consider?  
	- How to consider that problem?  
	- Why's it?  

##### Method WHY:
	The method that creates many questions in order to figure matter out:  
	- Why's this?  
	- Why's that ?  
	- Why is it A, not B? 
	- etc...  

When we create a lot of questions, it helps us know the information we need to use in order to figure **issue** out.

##### Method sky-rain-umbrella:
	- Sky: determine the **issue** .  
	- Rain: we already had the **issue** from step **Sky**, we're going to create the work we need to consider.  
	- Umbrella: we need to create the work specifically based on the **Rain** step.  

This is the pattern that I usually use in order to analyze the problem.

For example: **issue** **bring umbrella to work**  

<BlogImage
	path={'books/2/issue-umbrella-en'}
	alt={"Issue Umbrella"}
	layout="intrinsic"
	width={826}
	height={1126}
/>
  

### Conclusion

Hmm, So when we resolve a problem, we should consider whether do or do not resolve it, and if we want to resolve it, 
let's use this process:
 1. Understand **issue**. 
 2. Divide **issue**.  
 3. Create assumptions for each **issue**.  
 4. Test assumptions.  
 5. We can share the problem for anyone else in order to make sure we understand the **issue**.

And the last thing is don't say **If I don't do it, I don't know the result.**. We need to create the plan for our matter as the specifically way.
