I used to think in twenty years old we should do anything, receive all kinds of work.
The more work we do, the more experiences we get.

But I was wrong. I have realized that I have been working productive less for a long time.
 Do anything but only know a part of them. Then You guess it.üòÇ  

**Essentialism** is the book that opens a door for me about a new concept which I didn't know before.
Not only in my work, but This concept also made a big impact on my life too.

Let's consider it with me:

### Essentialism and Non-essentialism
#### Concept
Essentialism is things which very important, was considered after a process of research.

Non-essentialism is things which not important or important at the medium level. Of course, it doesn't make
a big impact on our life.

In this post, to avoid using the same word I'm gonna define:

	- **ESS**: essentialism
	- **NESS**: non-essentialism

In the working room, I saw a Japanese sister who was very different from other Japanese that I have known.
 She speaks a lot and smiles all of the time, communicates with other people and makes jokes.

Wow, that day I heard her said:

"_„ÅÑ„ÅÑ„Çà„ÄÅ‰Ωï„Åå„ÅÇ„Å£„Åü„ÇâÊåØ„Å£„Å¶‰∏ã„Åï„ÅÑ„ÄÇ_"(Ok, throw me anything.)

Before reading this book I thought this sister was very kind and maybe was a workafrolic person.
But after reading this book My thought has changed I realized this sister has been walking on **ESS** street.
And she thinks she can do anything and she's going to do all of them.
It's so dangerous.

The person has **ESS** who always think: _We can do anything but only do the most important thing._

Of course, If We go to the **NESS** way, We will know a lot of things. But Definitely, the quality is bad.
The person goes to **ESS** who will do the most important things. Then success in that work.

Please glance at the chart below: the left side: **NESS**, the right side: **ESS**. The energy will be divided if we go to **NESS** way.
If We go to **ESS** way, the energy will be concentrated and go in a specific way.

<Notes>
- **ESS**: must do, everything is important, do anything.
- **NESS**: should do, figure important thing out, do one thing.
</Notes>
#### Ability to choose
We knew the basic concept about **ESS** and **NESS** and at this point, I want to talk about one thing also
 important in order to make **ESS**. It's **Ability to choose**

I assert that when we were born, we have the ability to choose, the personal decision. We can choose friends, school and work.
But almost all of us forget it. Gradually, We lose this amazing ability.

The author Gerg McKeown told when his wife has been expecting a baby, his colleagues called and said:
"_We are wating you for the meeting with the customer._" 
 
He hesitated and didn't know what to do?
 
And the phone also rang:

"_We apologize when calling but can you go to the company  ?_"

He answered:

"_Yes. I'm going to go_"

Then when he arrived the office, his collagues said:

"_The customer will be happy when you are here while your wife is expected to have a baby._"

But, he really didn't know what the customer thinks. Finally, the meeting also failed.

He regretted, he condemned himself. 
Why at the most important time when his wife was in the hospital. He did something stupid.
He should be in hospital and take care of his wife.

The author hopes anyone don't make the same mistake as the way he did. Because of that he wrote this book and asserted:.
<Notes>
	Someone else can't take your ability to choose. In fact, you are fogetting it.

	If you don't draw your life, other people will come and draw for you instead.
</Notes>

#### Distractions
Actually, in this life, there are a lot of distractions. So we have to filter and remove them.
Let's focus on the most important things in our life.

If you can do one thing in your life which is very important and only have one time what would you want to do?

#### Trade-off
The person has **ESS** who does the most important thing and throw something else.

It doesn't mean we throw family, friends, hobby and only focusing on working üòÇ. 
When we choose something, we definitely must throw something.

Airline A with CEO B who has **ESS**. He implemented a new business for his airline.
He removed all services like: foods, epensive chair... and he allowed the customer can choose 
the chair in a freedom way. In the first time, he took a trade-off: the customer go away because
they don't want to go to the airline without foods. But he accepted it, he believed in his plan. Then after a while,
he succeeded. and a lot of customers came to his airline.

<Notes>
	When we choose one thing, we also lose one thing.
</Notes>
### Skill to see problem

How to consider **ESS** and figure out for yourself the important things to do. Let's use 5 skills below:

#### Isolation

Loneliness is really bad. I realized that when I have been living abroad. Go to work alone, come back home alone and eat alone.
It's boring. But I was wrong, the loneliness which we need to have in order to consider **ESS**. Instead of wasting time for boring.

Newton spent two years only stay at home and figure out the law of universal gravitation.

We need to have an isolation space, don't be distracted in order to think. In this busy life,
Have you ever stop a little bit and think something like:
 
- What should I do?
- What is important with me?
- Is it important to do?

Before starting something, we should take time to think, test it. It's really not easy.
 But we can practice and build a habit.

We engage our life: working, learning... and forget to take time for ourselves.

To illustrate: Bill Gate, whether on a rainy day or a sunny day, whether busy or free. He always takes time for himself.
He reads books every day. Each year he spent two months thinking. We aren't Bill Gate. But we can take time for ourselves too.
Reading books has a lot of benefits like increasing knowledge, discipline concentration, etc.

#### Filter information
The Internet has been developing. Too much news on Facebook, Twitter. But It doesn't mean all of the news is important.
We have too much distracting news. So we must filter them and need to select the important things.

The Journalist usually has this ability. It is different to compare with us. We usually hear all news that doesn't consider which is important.

#### Playing
The person has **NESS** who don't care about playing, they think playing is wasting time. Instead of playing, 
they should use that time to work. But the person has **ESS** don't think so. Playing is very important.
We can't live without playing. When we play we are ourselves. Playing helps to decrease stress, remove anxiety, 
improving the relationship, creative, and improving our health.

#### Sleep
I have a friend who learns very hard. he always sleeps late. He sleeps at 3 AM and wakes up at 9 AM.
With him, instead of sleeping, he should use that time to learn. Then every day, he wakes up in a tired mode.

I used to try to sleep the same way he did. Unfortunately, It's very insane. The next morning I wake up.
As a sad mummy, I can't concentrate on all of the things.

I think sleep is the correct investment. In fact, successful people sleep a lot. Because they
know sleep has a lot of benefits like improving health, increasing concentration for the next day, etc.
Let's sleep a day for 7-8 hours. I used to try to sleep 5-6 hours. But it doesn't work for me. üòÇ 

#### Base
The last skill I think it has a little bit strictly in here. We need to setup our base.
Do you know a rule it's called 90 points:

_If a thing greater than 90 points we will do, else throw it. 70-80 points are the medium point we must throw it._

When we clean clothes have you ever hesiated:

"_This T-shirt now I don't wear but some days I will wear it. Throwing is wasted._"

At this point, using rule 90 points: if we usually don't wear it. It means the point is lower than 90.
So we have to throw it.

Have you ever looked around and saw a lot of people did something. And you also did it because another person did.
I used to be in this situation. But indeed it's **NESS**.
Let's do things that we really want to do. Do things are important in our life.

In order to consider problem we have a effective process:

- Let's talk about the problem that is considering.
- Create three basic things and set the base for that problem.
- Create three ideal things and set the base for that problem.

If your problem doesn't match with three basic things, you definitely throw it.
And If it also doesn't match with three ideal things, you also must throw it.

### Skill to throw
#### Goal
In order to throw something aren't important. We have to setup for ourselves a specific goal.
If we don't have a specific goal, we will waster our time for something stupid. Additionally, If The goal
is ambiguous, we can't know what exactly need to do.


Let's aks your self:

_If I can do one thing, what I really want to do._

#### Refuse
Refusing something like a request from the boss or colleague who wants to help is not easy.
We usually don't want to hurt them. Don't want to be hated. Sometimes we don't think and say 
"_Ok I do I do._". But after do that, we regret, we condemn other people. It's not good.

So How can we refuse as a effective way? Let's use some methods below:

- When someone gives a job to you, Let's think it isn't your job.
- Let's refuse indirectly: "_I'm doing that thing._".
- Let's understand when we say "_Yes_", we also lose something like: time, ect...
- Refuse directly that we don't sell our time cheap.
- When they demand you, let's count to three before say your decision.
- Change to another time, another day.
- Using jokes to refuse without hurting them.
- Use affirmative sentences to refuse them.
- Let's introduce it to someone else.

<Notes>
	Say "Yes" slowly - Say "No" quickly.
</Notes>

#### Cancel
Have you ever bought a movie with tickets and when you watched it, it was really boring, but because of 
you spent money on that ticket you decided to keep watching even though you didn't like it?

We lose the money in the investment. Then we didn't accept it.
 We keep investing because we don't want to waste the money we spent.

This is the instinct of humans. When we owned something, we always think it's very important.
And we don't want to loose it.

So, How can we throw something that isn't important in the middle path?

Let's:
	- Think we ever never own it and if we spend money for it do we want to buy it?
	- Accept failure and pay attention to another thing.
	- Think 5 seconds: "Is it important?" before we do something.
	- Do a little bit of it. Then if it isn't ok, we will give up.

#### Draw limit
How to know whether we should accept or refuse something?

We need to draw our limit.  Let's try to remember: Sometimes, you accepted something and you did, then
you felt irritated. If you have this experience, definitely it's your limit.
Let's refuse without hesitation.

### Structuring skill
Structuring skill will be useful for us to achieve **ESS**. I will introduce something below:

#### The worst case
Before we do something, let's prepare the worst case for it. It helps us to avoid a lot of risks that happen without our desires.

Let's think:

- What are risks of this problem?
- What is the worst case?
- How does it affect other people?
- Can I accept these risks?
- How should I do to decrease these risks?

#### Small Success
We have two basic methods:

- Do very fast but only do one part. 
- Do slow but do all parts.

Which methods would you like to choose? I will choose the first method because It helps me resolve the 
small problem with a way easier and stressless. Instead of we do all parts and the results are really bad.

#### Live at the moment
"_What's important now?_" - What's important to you at the moment??

We always think about the part and the future. Then we forget we are living at the moment, we forget
the most important things we need to do now.

In order to live at the moment, it's not easy but we can practice. I know a method through exhale, inhale our stomach.
Let's take a deep inhale and ask yourself: 

"_What's the most important now?_"

<Notes>
When we live at the moment. We can increase the power in making decisions.
**ESS** is sometimes another person said "Yes" but you said "No", sometimes another person "Do" but you "Think",
sometimes another person "Stress" with working but you "Smile" and  concentrate on working,
sometimes another person "Update" profile vivid but you "Choose" a simple life.
</Notes>
#### Habit
In all books that I have read, I always see the author say about the habit.
The habit is very important. If you can do **ESS** as a habit, you will feel doing the important things are very normal.
The people do as the **NESS** way feel doing the important things are different, special 

You can change the bad habit to a good habit by a method as: after doing that thing, I will do one the important thing.
For example, each time I charge the PIN smartphone, I'm going to write the diary.

#### Leadership
With the person who works as a team leader has to control the team, **ESS** is necessary.
If the leader builds a team and doesn't have a specific goal, that team will go the bad way, mess up.

So the team leader needs to build a team with a common goal and have to follow the process of members.
And let's hire the person who can do work well and have a common goal with the team.
