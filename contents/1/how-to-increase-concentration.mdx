The content of this book is the sharing experience from Daigo - From a student at the last position about learning to amazing successful things like: passed Keio University,
the author of many famous books and the ability 1 day can read 20 books üò±. Daigo said all things he achieved, all of them he has to thanks to the concentration.
Let's go with Thang research on how Daigo disciplines his concentration üßê.

 ### Original sources of the concentration

Do you know? The concentration of us comes from the front's brain where create a thing power it's called Will Power.
This power helps us working and learning. Particularly, It isn't unlimited. It will decrease from morning to night you can realize that we feel less
performance at the night.

According to author if we can understand the method **saving** and **restoring** this power then we can increase the concentration and have a good performane at working.

Let's discover some methods help saving Will Power:

### Environment

The environment is a factor that probably stales our concentration then Will Power will be decreased.
In the desk desktop of us, we should not be distracted by some things like smartphone, iPad... In the room of Daigo, he only has the books, laptop.
Because of that, he can work with 100 % performance. He also talks about small things like the pen. He chooses a blue pen instead of a red pen which helps him concentrate.

### Diet

The diet is very important with the concentration of us. As Daigo said We should eat some foods have low GI like: fish, soba, yogurt, nuts...
Instead of eating the red meat like pork, beef because they have a lot of protein.

### Posture

If you sit in front of the desk, you should sit straight, 2 feet will touch on the ground, 
don't bow too low, butts and back are perpendiculars. This thing will help you have the best posture for concentration.

### Habit

According to the author: if we build the habit of that thing and in the next time we do it, our brain will not use Will Power
.We will use the cerebellum instead. Then we can save our Will Power and more productive on that day.
So we should build the habit of working or 1 skill that we desired it will help us have more power to concentrate.

### Doing excercises

Doing exercises is also very important in life I think everybody knows but to build a habit of doing exercises in a busy life isn't easy.
That is the time HIIT comes - HIIT is a method to do high-intensity exercises in a short time. If you do HIIT in 15 minutes it equals with you run 1 hour. 
Wow! Amazing! Now you can download HIIT app on two platforms Andoird or Ios.

### Meditation

When we talk about meditation, we usually think about religion. But indeed it isn't.  Meditation is a method 
of breath that was demonstrated in over the world. It helps decrease stress and restore power. This is the method of breath by using Diaphragm
Normally, we inhale our stomach will shrink, exhale stomach will expand. Opposite to this: inhale our stomach will expand, exhale
our stomach will shrink. Do it every day in the morning or before go to the bed to be more effective. 

### Sleep

Sleep is very important. In the world we have 3 types of people: less sleep(3 hours), sleep a lot(10 hours), 
sleep medium (7-8 hours). We almost belong to the third type and need sleep 7-8 hours every day. We should have the state deep sleep
at 10-2 hours. It will help our brain can have a break and review the knowledge during a day.
The most important thing is we have to build the habit and sleep at the same time every day. Don't see some devices have blue light like smartphones,
laptop... because it tastes bad for your sleep.

### Feeling

Let's write down some things you feel nervous about the stress in your life.  Let's use the negative feeling and
make it to motivation. For example: starting a new goal, a plan ext... If we are broken up.
There will be some free time for studying. lol

The author also said eyes are a part of big impact to our feeling ``tired``. So we should take a break for our eyes as much as possible.

Below is something that can be useful for you in your job or your learning:

### Some important things

- Morning: time to learn the new things.
- Afternoon: time to practice the things you learn in the morning.
- Night: time to review the knowledge we have learned, should not learn new thing on this time.
- When we create the plan should create 6 things by the prioritize 
- The people who have the best performance are the people who concentrate on the short time not long time.

### Some things shoud be did in the morning
