There is a video on _[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_0iPFzkNaQ)_
 that I always watch every morning before starting a new day.
In that video Takafumi Horie said about the changing of the world and what should we do to be happy in the future.

So I was curious to know about the life and mindset of Takafumi Horie and came to the book 
`Little By Litte From Zero` which said about how Takafumi Horie build everything from scratch after arrested.

### Introduce Author

Takafumi Horie wasn't born into a rich family.
 His parents were farmers. His father retired early. His mother was a workaholic person and didn't take care of his family.

So he always desires happiness from the family. When he was 10 years old, he had to go part-time. Because his parents want him to understand the importance of money 
and the life outside.

He didn't want to live a normal life in his hometown and he decided to leave his hometown and went to Tokyo for learning.
In Tokyo, he was exposed to a lot of information through reading books, internet and was fascinated by programming.

When he was 23 years old he dropped out his college, started his business and resounding success. 

But 34 years old, he was arrested for violating the stock exchange. 

During that time, the author lost everything: friends, career, money.
And the surprise was he rebuilt everything from scratch at 40 years old and became one of the people who had a big impact in Japan.

This post will talk about the mindset of the author.

### Works

He said that great work is the work that our hands make and take the time to confirm, testing it.
Don't do work we don't like or just for the money. If we do that, we can't persist it for a long time.

Have we ever feel the struggle and wonder ourselves that we don't like this work although it's so great and amazing work.
At that point, the author advises we don't need to love that job. Let's go and do it. Gradually, we will love it.

The importance is have to create a rule for yourself: `accept and do it` don't imagine, let's create the goal for that day. 

Sometimes we think some things `we can't do it` it's only we give up in the first time. We need to trust ourselves that we can do it.

Ex: A admires Gakky and wants to meet her in the real life. We will have 2 cases:

- Mindset `can't do it` A will give up and finish his desires immediately.
- Mindset `can do it` A will try to become an actor, cameraman... and someday he can meet Gakky.

The point here isn't having `ability` that it's `consciousness` we can do it and everything is possible.
Start from small things and accumulate from them. If we feel this work have a bit interesting, do it.

The author always advises us to start a business. If we fail, everything will start from scratch again but we will have a lot of
experiences: **Things were accumulated from each time we brave and do it**.

The work that we think doesn't have any meaning. We only don't understand it yet. Let's do it with 100% ability.

### Confident
The author doesn't agree with saving. Why do we need to save? It's simple we don't want to do some annoying things, don't have confidence
in the future and we have to save.

 The most important asset of our life is we have to trust ourselves. Let's trust ourselves: only we can believe ourselves. 
 We will start from zero and have confidence we can do anything.

If someone ask you "what do you eat for lunch ?" don't answer "I'm ok with anything". It's only we don't want to think, 
don't want to struggle. 

Getting marry we also have to choose who we love, choosing clothes we have to choose by our hand.
The author wants us always be curious, think about everything around us. Ex: why "we don't eat udon in the morning?"

Any difficulty doesn't rely on parents. If you always wait for your parents you are only are the "son" of them - don't think, let's be independent. 

If we feel alone we need to `challenge` -> `effort` -> `finish` something.

### At the moment

Sometimes we feel bored and we always remember the past and imagine something in the future. 
According to the author, we will lose important time, we need to `live at the moment`.

When we think about sadness, we can imagine anything. It just wastes time with something that doesn't make sense.

### Conclusion

We can memo somethings imporant that the author want to convey:

	- We need to trust ourselves.  
	- Live at the moment don't review the past, imagining the future.
	- Devote yourself with your work.  
	- Don't think negative, sadness.
